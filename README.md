# Cancer and AlphaMissense Accuracy

In this project, we hope to analyze Alpha Missense and determine if it is accurate for cancer driver genes and pathways. AlphaMissense was based on AlphaFold and extended their original model to predict pathogenicity of missense mutations across the human proteome. However, the AlphaMissense paper only barely touched on its possible applications in cancer, so it is still unclear how Alpha Missense performs with cancer data. An accurate pathogenicity predictor could be used to identify novel somatic driver mutations or predict patient outcomes.
